# a_viajem

This project is simple but quite complete. In this project I used Vue.js, Vuex, Quasar, Axios, Django, Django Rest Framework, Django Filter and SQLite.

It is divided in two parts: client and server

# Client

The client folder holds the client side project. It has been developed using the Quasar framework based in Vue.js. It`s responsive for mobile and desktop.

# Server

The server folder holds the server side project and the SQLite database. It has been developed using Django and Django Rest Framework to develop the endpoints (APIs) and manage the database.
